    <div>Hi. I am a Front-end Developer.
      I have 1 years commercial experience working in the Web Studio, providing responsive websites. The work I provide
      is of highest quality, fully responsive, and tested on different devices.
      I like to face with something new and interesting for me every day.
      My front-end build process involves the use of tools such as Sass, Grunt, Gulp, Bower, and NPM to speed up development.
